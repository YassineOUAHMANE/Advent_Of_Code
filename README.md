## 🖥️ This Repository
This repository contains my solutions for the **first 7 days** of **Advent of Code 2024**, implemented in **Python**. Each day's challenge involved unique problem-solving approaches, making the experience both **enriching** and **challenging**. 

### 📁 Structure
- `day_1/` - Solution for Day 1
- `day_2/` - Solution for Day 2
- `day_3/` - Solution for Day 3
- `day_4/` - Solution for Day 4
- `day_5/` - Solution for Day 5
- `day_6/` - Solution for Day 6
- `day_7/` - Solution for Day 7

Each folder contains:
- The Python script solving that day's challenge 
- A sample input file 
- `part_1.py` - Solution for Part 1
- `part_2.py` - Solution for Part 2 (which requires solving Part 1 first)

## 🚀 My Experience
Participating in **Advent of Code 2024** has been an **amazing learning experience**. Each challenge pushed me to think critically, optimize my solutions, and experiment with different techniques in Python. Some days were **straightforward**, while others were **quite tricky**, but overcoming those challenges was incredibly **rewarding**!

I look forward to continuing the journey and solving more challenges in the upcoming days. 🚀
